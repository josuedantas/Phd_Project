# PhD Project: Weed Identification in Sugarcane Plantation

This project aims to identify weeds in sugarcane plantations using advanced image processing techniques. The methodology integrates **Haar-like features**, **fuzzy logic**, and **connected components** for accurate detection of weeds in agricultural fields.

## Technologies and Techniques
- **Haar-like Features**: Feature extraction technique to identify patterns in plant structures.
- **Fuzzy Logic**: Employed to manage uncertainty in classification decisions, enhancing accuracy.
- **Connected Components**: Used for segmentation and analysis of image regions to identify and isolate weeds.
- **OpenCV**: Framework used for image processing, including pre-processing, feature extraction, and segmentation.

## Objective
The primary goal is to improve the precision of weed detection, reduce manual labor, and optimize crop management practices.

## Tools Used
- **C++**
- **OpenCV**
